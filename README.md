This project is a website-based application designed to assist users in donating, as well as helping people in need in meeting their goods needs, which I built with my colleagues on campus, namely:

1. Ayesha Aprillia S
2. Fadjrin Diraja Muhammad
3. M Dzikri Alfarisyi

In its implementation, we use the CodeIgniter 4 framework with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript languages in the development process, also assisted by Figma in the process of designing the UI/UX of this application.
